# Constraint
The application is geared to a variety of users (biologists) around the world. Before developing a project, we must consider some major constraints to reduce my workload.
## Browser Compatibility
Because applications are designed for widely used applications, they should be cross-platform compatible to meet a variety of users. Therefore, the application should be accessible through Firefox, Chrome and Safari.
## Space complexity
Consider not only the time complexity, but also the space complexity. There are two aspects of spatial complexity. One is the size of the entire Web application. Applications should not be larger than 1GB. On the other hand, when an application starts data analysis, it must limit its memory footprint to a certain level to ensure that the system works in an appropriate way.
## Budget
Budget is less than $10,000.
## System downtime
The downtime of the system is less than 30 minutes per year to meet the huge demand of users for data analysis.
