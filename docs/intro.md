# introduction
In biology, the gene expression may be influenced by the external environment is proposed. in this docs, The gene expression of the scatter diagram of program visualization expression more intuitive description of the biologists meet requirements for gene.

## objective
It is advisable to visualized analysis differential expression of genes.

##  Summary
The program requires users to upload a file with. txt or. xls files as file extensions. The document must contain three columns, gene ID, control sample and treatment sample. After uploading the file, the software will return to the user the expression scatter plot whose X-axis is controlled and Y-axis is processed. If the file submitted by the user is incorrect or incomplete, the program will prompt the user to upload the relevant files correctly.

## User characteristics
Users should be biologists, biology researchers, University professors, etc. They need to automatically generate gene expression scatter plot visualization through the network. Visual data is more conducive to users'intuitive analysis. Users are more willing to complete this work through a simple and friendly interface.

## Terminologies
Control sample - A cell sample prepared in its normal condition.

Treatment sample - A cell sample treated by special chemicals, or in which some genes are altered.

Differentially expressed genes - The genes which have significantly different expression levels between two samples.

Up-regulation - A gene is said to be up-regulated if it has higher expression in treatment than in control.

## Abbreviations
OMG - Oh My Genes.

logFC - log fold change of gene expression. log_2 [T/C], where T is the gene expression level from a treatment sample, while C is the gene expression level.
